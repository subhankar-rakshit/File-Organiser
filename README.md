# File-Organiser
We download different kinds of files from the internet like videos, audios, pdf files, jpg files, etc.
So our download folder becomes messy and it looks complicated. To find some particular things from this folder becomes very hard.
Here I created a way to resolve that problem using GUI mode.

TO-DO:
1. Select particular folder that you want to organise.
2. Then press the click submit button and check the selected folder.

Requirements:

->Tkinter module


Installation:

->For Linux: sudo apt-get install python3-tk


->For Windows: pip install tk

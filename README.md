# File-Organiser
We download different kind of files from internet like video file, audio file, pdf file, jpg file etc.
So our download folder becomes messy and it looks like complicated. To find some particular things from this folder becomes very hard.
Here I created a way to resolve that problem using gui mode.

TO-DO:
1. Select particular folder that you want to organise.
2. Then press the click submit button and check the selected folder.

Requirements:
Install Tkinter if you don't have it.


Installation:
~For Linux: sudo apt-get install python3-tk


~For Windows: pip install tk
